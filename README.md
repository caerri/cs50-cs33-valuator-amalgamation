# final-project
This final project ended as an amalgamation between CS50 and CS12 at HES November 2024. 

Primary contributions dedicated to CS50 were backend related for authentication and backend validation, learning and deploying Flask, data storage, SQLite, and limited HTML and CSS elements.

Primary contributions dedicated to CS12 were more frontend related. Javascript and listeners for UI and client validation, learning to iterate via Javascript for redundant pieces, APIs with OpenStreetMaps and Google Places. Limited access to ATTOM property data API during project led to limited fields successfully mapped. 

APIs keys are defunct. 

I am aware that they will show up here. They are meaningless now.
